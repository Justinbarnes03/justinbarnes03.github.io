                    <p>Fishing with streamers, midge larvae, and big stonefly patterns might yield some trout. The South Fork stays open all year, but the Swan Valley is in a pocket that traps cold air; it can be colder here in winter than other rivers.

                    <p>The regulations are a bit complicated, so be sure to read them thoroughly. The river is open all year between the Warm River confluence and Ashton Dam, and downstream from Vernon Bridge (check the regs for details). Midges, some blue-winged olives, and streamers are most effective in this water.

                        The Big Lost below Mackay Dam can be a viable winter destination, depending on flows. If the flows are low , the water stays clear and the river is wadable. Due to the clear water, you can often sight-fish on sunny days. Just remember that the fish can see you, too, so be stealthy.
                        <br> Size 20-24 midges and blue-winged olives are the dominant bugs. Size 16 red Brassies are another good pattern to carry. If the river is low, non-beadhead nymphs are often best because they don't make as much fuss when they hit the water.
                        <br> You might see trout feeding just below the surface. A small non-beadhead Pheasant Tail can work well at that time. When it gets cold the trout will stay near the bottom and your fly will need to travel at that level to be effective.

                        Flows throughout the river are lower than average, and most of the river banks are free of ice and snow. Boat ramps are open, but walk-in wade fishing is just as convenient.  Triploid rainbows in moderate sizes are responding well to Zonkers. There are many places available for walk-in wade fishing.
