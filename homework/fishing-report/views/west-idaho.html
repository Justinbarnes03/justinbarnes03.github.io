                    <p>The early winter standards--blue-winged olives, midges, streamers--apply here. Black and brown are the two best color choices for streamers in this river.<br>When fishing with streamers, figure trout could be anywhere. During midge or blue-winged olives hatches, concentrate on the edges, fast/slow current seams, backeddies, and slower water.
<br>Whitefish are not a major factor here, so egg imitations are not very effective.

                    <p> It's that time of the year when the flows are low and the fish are pairing up getting ready to spawn, keep an eye out in riffles for redds and give those fish a break. look for morning and mid afternoon midge and BWO hatches in the slicks. tossing some meaty streamers in deeper pools could pick up some hefty browns. Fill your fly box with small midge patterns, small baetis nymphs, small leech streamers, and  wooly buggers.

                        Flows throughout the river are lower than average, and most of the river banks are free of ice and snow. Boat ramps are open, but walk-in wade fishing is just as convenient. Fish are responding well to Sculpin Patterns and Glo Bugs. Make sure to pack extra clothing just incase you take a "swim".

                        The Payette is still a fishing option in the wintertime! For dry flies we recommend throwing a small attractor like a parachute adams or royal wulff. Nymphing will likely be the most productive. Throw a medium to large attractor nymph like a frenchie or prince nymph and trail behind it a caddis pupae or zebra midge. Cover the water and don’t hesitate to relocate if you aren’t into fish right away. Drive safe.
