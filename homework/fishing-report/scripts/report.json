                "Big B-run steelhead are in the river as well as smaller A-runs. When the river is low and clear, use sparse size 6-8 Green Butt Skunks, Purple Perils, and other traditional steelhead flies. With arrival of cold weather, sink-tip lines have become the rule. Fishing will be tough due to cold water.",

                "Mid-afternoon is the best time here in early winter. Mostly, streamers are the best choice. Black Zonkers, Egg Sucking Leeches, and Woolly Buggers are effective, as are Muddlers. Because this is a cutthroat river, trout will move toward the lower end (closer to the lake). You'll probably find them in deeper pools below Pritchard.",

                "As on the Coeur d'Alene system, mid-afternoon is the best time here. Mostly, streamers are the best choice. Black Zonkers, Egg Sucking Leeches, and Woolly Buggers are effective, as are Muddlers.",

                "The pools are usually the best places to find the westslope cutthroat. The lower river--near Lowell--often fishes best in winter. Be careful on the roads. Mostly, streamers are the best choice. Black Zonkers, Egg Sucking Leeches, and Woolly Buggers are effective, as are Muddlers."]
