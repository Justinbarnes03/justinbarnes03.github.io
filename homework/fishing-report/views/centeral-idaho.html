                    <hr>
                    <p>Nymphs and Woolly Buggers work well here in the winter. It's not a hatch-oriented river, but there are occasional winter midge hatches that catch the attention of trout and anglers should be prepared with the appropriate imitations.<br>
                    Steelhead should be available, but they will be increasingly tough to catch as the water turns frigid. Sink-tip lines with an Egg Sucking Leech, or indicator tactics might help.

                    <p>  The Selway is located deep in the heart of the Frank Church Wilderness. This is not a good winter option. You will die and no one will find you. Find another river or stay home and tie some flies. If you have a death wish be sure to bring warm clothes and some BWO', Bruised Leeches, Woolly Buggars, and Pheasant Tails.

                        The Big Wood below Ketchum can have decent blue-winged olive hatches in December. The blue-wings are typically size 20-22 and are matched with a Sparkle Dun. As the weather gets cold, midges will dominate the action.
<br>Size 16-18 red Copper Johns or red Brassies are a good fly choice, too, and it doesn't hurt to carry some size 8-10 olive Woolly Buggers to use in the deeper water. Make sure your nymphs are on the bottom.

                        The Conservancy water is closed. Downstream from there, look for hatches of blue-winged olives and midges. Look for rising fish; these are not spawners. Streamers, midges, and blue-winged olives are good choices here.
