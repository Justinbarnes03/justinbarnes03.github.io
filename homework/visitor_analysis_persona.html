                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->

                <p>
                    The demographic of this site is very broad but is mostly males. It targets people who enjoy many outdoors hobbies such as: Hunting, shooting, fishing, boating, camping auto and atvs. The age ranges from 14-80+ year olds. the education of this demographic is very broad as well from highschool drop outs to Doctorates and masters. The geographic locations spans across the United States.
                    <br> I felt this site met all the users needs by being easy to navigate and organized. The site has great alignment and use of white space.
                    <br> The content on this site is organized neatly. I found it very easy to navigate. The home page has deals and offer they have at the current moment. At the top of the site there is a nav bar which has a drop down organized into many different categories: Shop, Save, Learn, Cabelas club visa's and gift cards. Inside of those categories there are more pages with the specifics of each item. Like almost every site if you click the Cabelas logo int he top left it takes you back to the home page. The nav bar also contains. A search bar, and find a store near me and a shopping cart.

                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the persona reading to build a persona for this site-->
                <p>The Cabelas website user is someone who loves the outdoors. 30-40 years old. some one who makes anywhere from $40,000-$80,000 a year Likes to hunt, fish and adventure. He's probably someone who is too busy to actually go in the store, which is why he orders online. </p>
